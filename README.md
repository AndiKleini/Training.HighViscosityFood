# Training.HighViscosityFood
An example for too high complexity and viscosity in design.

This repository contains a training project for dealing with viscosity in design. By comparing three different branches, that are simulating a real world development scenario, one can see the impact of high viscosity on design during ongoing development. It helps to understand the problem and let one think about design preserving elements in code.

## The background story

Like in any other software project, a small backgroundstory of involved developers can be related. 

### The first (basic) version

Once upon a time Clare, who is a very experienced software developer, was hired to create a system for some food corner. The business was young and the budget was low. Consequently Clare developed some basic features into the system to enable the business and make selling food possible. This initial, basic version can be checked out on master branch.
