# Training.HighViscosityFood
An example for too high complexity and viscosity in design.

This repository contains a training project for dealing with viscosity in design. By comparing three different branches, that are simulating a real world development scenario, one can see the impact of high viscosity on design during ongoing development. It helps to understand the problem and let one think about design preserving elements in code.
