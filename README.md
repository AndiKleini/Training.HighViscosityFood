# Training.HighViscosityFood
An example for too high complexity and viscosity in design.

This repository contains a training project for dealing with viscosity in design. By comparing three different branches, that are simulating a real world development scenario, one can see the impact of high viscosity on design during ongoing development. It helps to understand the problem and let one think about design preserving elements in code.

## The background story

Like in any other software project, a small backgroundstory of involved developers can be related. 

### The first (basic) version

Once upon a time Clare, who is a very experienced software developer, was hired to create a system for some food corner. The business was young and the budget was low. Consequently Clare developed some basic features into the system to enable the business and make selling food possible. This initial, basic version can be checked out on master branch. Customers were lucky and started their business.

### Eddies changes 

After some weeks it figured out that more and more customers preferred taking away the food instead of eating it in the food corner. This implies the need of wrapping the food. Stackholders decide to let their customers pay for it, which resulted in a new feature:
Wrap the food and increase the overall price.
